Endocrine tumours are rare, and range from well-differentiated indolent tumours to poorly-differentiated aggressive malignancies. Thyroid carcinoma, the most common endocrine gland malignancy, is discussed in separately (chapter 16). This chapter deals with neuroendocrine neoplasms, and tumours of the adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2 <span class="h4">Neuroendocrine neoplasms</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Nomenclature of these rare tumours has been varied over time and still is somewhat confusing, with overlapping synonymous definitions for carcinoids, APUDomas, argentaffin tumours, and tumours of the diffuse endocrine system.<span class="s22">1 </span>Pearse et al. first described several apparently disparate cell series in the body such as adrenomedullary chromaffin cells, enterochromaffin cells, the corticotroph, the melanotroph, the pan- creatic islet B cell, and the thyroid C cell, which all share common cytochemical and ultrastructural properties including amine precursor uptake and decarboxylase (APUD) activity within the cells.<span class="s22">2 </span>A generic name—APUD cells—was later proposed for these cells and its list has since expanded. The structural and chemical simi- larity of APUD cells to neurons suggested a neural crest origin and these cells are distributed throughout the body, where they are all prone to both hyperplasia and neoplasia. More recently the term ‘neuroendocrine neoplasms’ has been adopted for these tumours, which are then classified based on clinical features, histology, and proliferation into well-differentiated (low and intermediate grade tumours) and poorly-differentiated (high grade) neuroendocrine carcinomas. Most literature focuses also on anatomic subtypes (i.e. gastroenteropancreatic, pulmonary, etc.). Reference to old nomenclature is, however, still quite common in clinical practice. Currently, these tumours are usually classified on the basis of their topographical location as foregut (arising from thymus, lung, stomach, duodenum, and pancreas), midgut (jejunum, ileum, and ascending colon), and hindgut tumours (arising from distal colon and rectum).</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2.1 <span class="s124">Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas</span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2.1.1 <span class="s66">Clinical background</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNETs) are rare and typically functioning tu- mours, producing excessive amounts of specific hormones.<span class="s22">3,4 </span>Patients may present with characteristic symptoms suggesting the possibility of a particular tumour type. Insulinoma is probably the most common tumour (incidence 1 per million per year) and usually has hypoglycaemia as the presenting symptom.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Other tumour subtypes include gastrinomas, glucagonomas, VIPomas, and somatostatinomas. Gastrinomas produce high levels of gastrin which stimulates the secretion of excessive gastric acid leading to ulcers and diarrhoea (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Glucagonomas produce excessive glucagon and lead to hyperglycaemia, which causes frequent urination, increased thirst, increased hunger, and a rash that spreads on the face, abdomen, or lower extremities (necrolytic migratory erythema). VIPomas produce vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a hormone that plays a role in intestinal water transport and causes chronic, watery diarrhoea, low serum potassium, low gastric hydrochloric acid, flushing, fatigue, and nausea. Somatostatinomas pro- duce somatostatin, a hormone that inhibits the secretion of several other hormones such as growth hormone, insulin, and gastrin. Thus it can produce type II diabetes, gallstones, steatorrhoea, diarrhoea, weight loss, and lower gastric hydrochloric acid secretion. Functioning tumours also include PPomas (watery diarrhoea syndrome or absence of clinical symptoms), GRFoma (acromegaly due to ectopic secretion of GH- releasing factor) and ACTHoma (ectopic ACTH, Cushing’s syndrome). These are all relatively rare, and overlap with non-pancreatic gut-derived neuroendocrine tumours with and without carcinoid syndrome.<span class="s22">3</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Non-functioning tumours make up the majority of islet cell tumours. They produce</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">none of the hormones and thus present with no characteristic clinical syndromes as already mentioned. As a result, they are typically diagnosed at more advanced stages of disease. Approximately 90% of insulinomas are benign, but the per- centage is considerably less for gastrinomas. Between 8% insulinomas and 20–25% glucagonomas, and gastrinomas are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type-1 (MEN-1) syndrome, where they are multicentric and all have a capacity for metastatic spread. The prognosis and survival of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) are related to pathological features, includ- ing tumour differentiation, Ki-67 index, tumour size, invasion, and the presence of metastases.<span class="s22">3,4</span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2.1.2 <span class="s66">Diagnosis and staging</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Diagnosis is usually established following clinical suspicion, serum tests, and imaging. Serum tests include gut hormone profile and other relevant endocrine tests, in particular plasma chromogranin A, a useful marker in all these tumours. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endo- scopic ultrasound (EUS) play an important role in locating the primary tumour and detecting metastases.<span class="s22">5 </span>Scintigraphy with radiolabelled somatostatin analogue <span class="s22">111</span>In-octreotide has a sensitivity of 82–95% for detecting islet-cell tumours and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="364" alt="image" src="Image_284.gif"/></span></p><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(a)</p><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(a)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(a)</p><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(b)</p><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(b)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(b)</p><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(c)</p><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(c)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(c)</p><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(d)</p><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(d)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s70" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(d)</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Fig. 19.1 <span class="s25">A 35-year-old male patient with known metastatic pancreatic net. pet/Ct scan illustrates Ga-68-octreotide avid multiple liver metastases (arrow) and a pre-aortic node (dash arrow).

Biochemical follow-up is far more sensitive than imaging. Gut neuroendocrine tumours often pursue an indolent course over many years, and symp- tomatic palliation of the sequelae of their endocrine products forms an important part of management. Most inoperable or metastatic neuroendocrine tumours ex- press a high density of somatostatin receptors. Among treatments for these tumours, radiolabelled somatostatin analogues have been utilized.

They may be found in any age group. About 85% of carcinoid tumours develop in the gastrointestinal tract, 10% in the lung, and the rest in various organs such as thymus, kidney, ovary, and prostate. The most common sites are the appendix, small bowel, and rectum. Carcinoids constitute about 34% of all tumours in the small intes- tine, but only 1% of all neoplasms in the stomach, colon, or rectum. Liver is the most common metastatic site and the metastases have one of the longest doubling times of any malignant human tumour. Despite enormous hepatomegaly, patients may remain well for a long time.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Several factors should be considered when evaluating carcinoid tumours for meta- static behaviour. These include the location of the primary tumour (approximately 70% of colonic carcinoids give rise to metastases, compared to 30–60% of ileal tu- mours and only 2–5% of appendiceal carcinoids), the size of the primary tumour (70% of tumours &gt;2 cm and 6% &lt;1 cm develop metastases). In addition, the depth of tu- mour penetration into the bowel wall and the histological growth pattern of the tu- mour are also important factors.<span class="s22">8,9</span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2.2.1 <span class="s66">Diagnosis and staging</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of a midgut carcinoid tumour may be suspected by clinical symptoms suggestive of carcinoid syndrome or by the presence of other symptoms such as ab- dominal pain. Urinary 5-HIAA has been reported to have a sensitivity of around 70% and a specificity of 100% in patients with carcinoid syndrome. Plasma chromogranin A is the most sensitive marker (100%) but its specificity is lower than urinary 5-HIAA since almost all neuroendocrine tumours show increased levels of chromogranin A.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Imaging plays a crucial role in detecting and characterizing carcinoid tumours. Scintigraphy using radiolabelled somatostatin analogues such as <span class="s22">111</span>In-octreotide has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of carcinoid tumour in the past. PET with Ga-68 somatostatin analogues has been shown to be superior in this group of patients as well.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2.2.2 <span class="s66">Therapeutic assessment and follow-up</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Surgical treatment should be considered in every patient with a carcinoid tumour and operable disease should be resected. Although the majority of patients with midgut carcinoid tumours presenting with a carcinoid syndrome have liver metastases and cannot be cured surgically, excision of discrete hepatic metastases of this slowly growing tumour is perceived to be clinically beneficial.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Whilst external beam radiotherapy has been mostly reserved for treating painful bone metastases, radionuclide therapy is becoming of increasing importance. Therapy with the lutetium-177 labelled somatostatin analogue DOTATATE has been validated in the phase III Netter-1 study which showed significant increase in progression free</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">and overall survival in the treatment arm and low (~20% objective response rates, com- plete and partial response based on RECIST criteria).<span class="s22">10 </span>Treatment in this setting is ap- proved by the FDA and EMEA. Somatostatin analogues effectively control symptoms in 40–80% patients with the carcinoid syndrome, with a reduction of biochemical markers in up to 40%. Stabilization of tumour growth has been observed in 24–57% of patients, with documented tumour progression prior to somatostatin therapy. However, partial and complete tumour response has been observed in &lt;10% of patients. The problem of tachyphylaxis to somatostatin analogues occurs in the great majority of patients and hinders the duration of therapeutic response (median 12 months).</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2.3 <span class="s124">Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the lung</span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2.3.1 <span class="s66">Clinical background</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">These, also referred to as bronchial carcinoids, are the most common ‘benign’ bron- chial tumour. They arise endobronchially and frequently in the major bronchi. They usually present with haemoptysis or bronchial obstruction, and resection (lobectomy, pneumonectomy) is usually curative. Approximately 5% of bronchial carcinoids show nodal metastases and atypical carcinoids show more aggressive behaviour and could metastasize to mediastinal lymph nodes (30–50% cases), with a five-year survival rate of 40–60%.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2.3.2 <span class="s66">Diagnosis and staging</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The use of Ga-68 labelled somatostatin analogues for PET imaging is superior to traditional scintigraphy (Figure 19.2) and its application has been shown to impact patient management.<span class="s22">11 </span>The combined use of <span class="s22">68</span>Ga-somatostatin analogues and <span class="s22">18</span>F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT can be useful for lesion grading, identifying heterogeneity, and improving staging accuracy.<span class="s22">12</span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.2.3.3 <span class="s66">Therapeutic assessment and follow-up</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">For faster-growing disease, aggressive and atypical carcinoids, the combination of cisplatin and etoposide is favoured, as for the more malignant islet cell tumours.

The measurement of 24-hour urinary free catecholamine has a high sensitivity for phaeochromocytoma. In a symptomatic patient, sensitivity approaches 100%.

Most functioning cortical adenomas are found in female patients. Those occurring in pre- pubertal patients tend to present with virilization, whereas those in post-pubertal patients present with Cushing’s syndrome. Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare ma- lignancy, with an annual incidence of 4–12 cases per million population. It can be functioning or non-functioning. The left adrenal has been documented as the more common site and the disease is rarely bilateral.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.4.2 <span class="s124">Diagnosis and staging</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Non-specific abdominal symptoms such as fullness, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and pain are usually the most common clinical presenting features. Between one- quarter and one-third of patients with primary adrenal carcinoma have clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction at presentation, most commonly Cushing’s syndrome, often supplemented by virilism. A slightly higher fraction of the pa- tients show evidence of abnormal hormone secretion, that is, subclinical dysfunc- tion. Feminizing tumours due to over-secretion of oestrogens are rare (10%), as are aldosterone-secreting tumours (2%). As for suspected cortical adenomas, diag- nostic tests include the demonstration of excessive and non-suppressible levels of adrenal steroids.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Imaging is an essential adjunct to clinical and biochemical findings in the diag- nosis of adrenal tumours. Both CT and MRI have the capability to detect adrenal tumours &lt;5 mm and indeed, small adrenal tumours are sometimes detected on imaging of the abdomen by CT or MRI for an ostensibly unrelated reason—the so- called ‘incidentaloma’. FDG-PET/CT has been shown to detect metastases and recur- rence of adrenocortical tumours with impressive sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 99%, and accuracy of 98%. PET imaging with radiolabelled cortisol analogues such as <span class="s22">11</span>C-metomidate have been utilized to characterize adrenal masses of cortical origin.<span class="s22">18</span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19.4.3 <span class="s124">Therapeutic assessment and follow-up</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The treatment of an adrenal tumour depends on the size and location of the tumour. Various algorithms have been proposed to differentiate tumours that require sur- gical removal from those that can be simply monitored, most attempting to exclude a hypersecretory state biochemically and assess the probability of adrenal malignancy on imaging criteria. In general, small (&lt;3 cm) lesions with ‘benign’ imaging character- istics can be simply observed and rescanned at intervals.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">19.5 <span class="h4">Summary</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">Endocrine tumours represent a diverse group of tumours.</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">Diagnosis is suggested by clinical presentation and usually confirmed by biochem- ical tests, but a variety of imaging techniques may be used to localize and stage disease, including CT, MRI, EUS.</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">Nuclear medicine methods have an increasing role in lesion detection, biological characterization, and radionuclide therapy of advanced disease.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s126" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">References</p><p class="s74" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">1. <b>Hajdu SI</b>, <b>Tang P </b>(2008).
