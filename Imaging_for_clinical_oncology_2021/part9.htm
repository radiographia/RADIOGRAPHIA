The confidence in the anatomical representation of CT-based planning has paved the way for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) across a range of tumour sites, where radiotherapy dose is sculpted in great adherence to the underlying anatomy. Better visualization of soft tissue with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the cap- ability of positron emission tomography (PET) scan in accurately measuring biological function have led to the application of these modalities in radiotherapy planning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.2 <span class="h4">Computed tomography</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Current clinical practice of radiotherapy planning of lesions at depth is predominantly CT-based.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Typically, dedicated CT planning scans are acquired at the start of the radiotherapy planning process with the patient in the treatment position in order to maintain geo- metric accuracy throughout planning process. It is used in radiotherapy volume de- lineation, dose calculation, treatment verification, and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) systems. Although 3D images are commonly used, 4D scans can combat mo- tion issues relevant to body sites such as the thorax.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Use of CT-alone for radiotherapy planning has numerous pitfalls. The presence of metallic implants such as hip replacements and dental fillings arise in streak artefacts in the acquired CT images, which can be substantial relative to the size of the implants. Although the soft tissue contrast of CT images is generally good across a range of body sites, which could be enhanced with intravenous (IV) contrast, on many occasions the visualization is suboptimal (e.g. differentiation between lung tumour and adjacent atelectasis/collapse). Large inter- and intra-observer variation in CT-based volume delineation has been reported for several tumour sites, which can potentially lead to marginal misses and/or suboptimal sparing of normal tissues. For these reasons there has been a drive to adopting other modalities in the radiotherapy treatment pathway.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.3 <span class="h4">Magnetic resonance imaging</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">MRI images are being increasingly used for radiotherapy delineation, primarily due to superiority in soft-tissue contrast compared to CT. The absence of radiation exposure during image acquisition, is particularly preferred for the younger population. The gadolinium-based contrast used in MRI has less risk of nephrotoxicity compared with iodinated CT contrast agents. Additionally, unlike CT scanning, where data acquisi- tion is performed in the axial plane, MR images can be obtained in any orientation, thereby having greater scope in functionality, which can be tailored and aligned ac- cording to the tumour and anatomy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.3.1 <span class="s29">Magnetic resonance workflow in radiotherapy systems</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Electron density obtained from CT-based imaging is required for tissue dose calcu- lations. Thus, MRI-only radiotherapy planning workflows are restricted in their cap- ability for estimating dose distributions as image intensity in MRI does not directly correlate with electron density. Currently, most institutions are acquiring separate MRI and CT planning scans which are then used together in the radiotherapy plan- ning process.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">Ideally, MRI scans should be performed with patients immobilized in the same pos- ition as treatment delivery. Historically, the physical size of the MRI bore limited the use of immobilization devices and, unlike planning CT scan, most diagnostic MRI scanners employ different set-up that focus on patient comfort. Due to the increasing demand for MRI use in radiotherapy processes and with larger bore scanners, commer- cial systems are developing products and solutions compatible with radiotherapy use. Co-registration of MRI with CT planning images is commonly done using rigid fusion algorithms based on bone anatomy. It is crucial to ensure that the quality of image alignment is satisfactory to avoid a systematic geometric error during treat- ment. Despite the presence of multiple fusion algorithms, errors are inherently intro- duced in this process, especially if there are marked differences in patient position between the scans. Not only can matching be poor with inadequate soft tissue contrast information, differences in the tissue contrast between multimodality imaging can lead to poorer accuracy as compared to single modality registration. The lack of ro- bust measures for quality assessment of co-registration increases the complexity of the problem. The deficiencies of image registration are well recognized, and there remains a continuous pursuit for rigorous solutions to address this issue, such as deformable</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">registration algorithms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.3.2 <span class="s29">Contrast and soft tissue visualization/artefacts</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The use of higher field strengths with higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) results in greater contrast and improved soft tissue resolution. The enhanced visualization of the anatomy for both tumour and organs at risks (OARs) is hugely advantageous as it allows greater accuracy in volume delineation, which is desired in highly conformal treatment delivery such as IMRT. Furthermore, delineation accuracy is imperative in stereotactic treatment techniques where the precision of the delivery allows larger</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">doses per fraction to be used safely whilst minimizing the dose to normal tissues. There are many developments in treatment boosts and dose escalation with MRI- based planning capitalizing on its edge over CT-only systems.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">However, there is conflict between obtaining MRI images of high SNR with high spatial resolution in a short time. Due to the different tumour and tissue constituents for a given body site, multiple MRI sequences are often required in order to elicit im- ages with clinically useful contrast characteristics. Together with the acquisition of further functional sequences, execution of MRI workflows is usually more complex due to the tailoring of several different sequences according to the specific site and pathology.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Many metal implants in current clinical use are MRI compatible. During the scan, local currents within metal implants induced by the radiofrequency and gradient fields disrupt the homogeneity of the magnetic field and result in susceptibility artefacts, which cannot be completely eliminated in spite of image distortion minimization techniques. This results in images with residual regions of signal loss and accumula- tion, which can compromise the radiotherapy planning process. Specialist techniques such as the use of high image gradients to minimize signal loss often come at a cost of increase in acquisition time. Nonetheless, the impact of these artefacts is generally of a much smaller magnitude in MRI as compared to CT.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.3.3 <span class="s29">Treatment position/motion</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Ordinarily, CT acquisition takes place over seconds compared to tens of minutes for multiple MRI sequences, where the former is more reflective of the timescales for radiotherapy delivery.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Longer duration for image acquisition is often required in order to obtain images with higher spatial resolution and sufficient image quality, especially of larger body sites such as the pelvis. This augments the risk of subject motion which can jeop- ardize image quality through blurring. Physiological motion of particular body or- gans can result in ‘ghost’ appearances from the reproduction of the object along the phase-encode direction. It may not be possible to match physiological motion (e.g. free breathing) that is captured on MRI examinations directly to radiotherapy delivery, and planning margins for motion assessment may have to be performed separately.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Time-sensitive 4D MRI images can be obtained through the capture of several mo- tion cycles which is then averaged according to the specific phase of motion, in com- parison to 4D CT where a single motion cycle is typically acquired. However, irregular physiological motion can give rise to errors in the estimate of 4D MRI which can in turn compromise image quality. Further advances in faster sampling techniques, par- allel imaging, and computation can improve this.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.3.4 <span class="s29">Geometric accuracy</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The geometric accuracy of MRI images is dependent on the uniformity of the static magnetic field and gradient linearity. Any warping of the field and gradient can lead to distorted images that affect the portrayal of anatomical features in their respective locations.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Due to the trade-off between magnet size and gradients of high magnitude with high slew rates, most MRI images are highly accurate geometrically in the centre of the field of view, which become increasingly distorted towards the periphery, up to a few centimetres at the edges. Thus, this phenomenon has greater impact on larger body sites such as the pelvis, compared to the head. The presence of a subject can also disturb the magnetic field and, depending on the presence of im- plants and curvature of structures, result in patient-based distortion to varying degree. The differences in distribution of <span class="s22">1</span>H nuclei between fat and water in body tissues also result in signal readouts at frequencies that are slightly offset (i.e. chemical shift).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In the setting of radiotherapy planning where geometric integrity is paramount, careful selection of pulse sequence parameters to achieve high SNR through the balance of high gradient amplitude and high receiver bandwidth is required to miti- gate both system- and patient-related geometric distortion. Although post-processing corrections are often applied to limit geometric distortion, this can affect image quality. Additionally, the choice of MR sequences applied to radiotherapy planning has to be circumspect, especially as some uncorrected functional MRI imaging techniques are known to produce significant warping near air interfaces.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.3.5 <span class="s29">Electron density estimation</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Various methods have been used to establish an MR-only radiotherapy planning process to simplify the planning pathway, minimize radiation exposure of CT scanning, and eliminate the uncertainties associated with multi-modality image registration.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">This involves the construction of MR-based CT equivalent images (i.e. substitute or synthetic CT (s-CT)) generated from MRI data. Although a good approximation of dosimetry can be achieved through bulk electron density assignment, where ei- ther single or multiple electron densities are designated according to specific tissue types, this has not taken off due to the time-consuming process of tissue segmenta- tion. Specialized MRI techniques such as ultra-short echo time sequences, which can distinguish and therefore separate tissue types, have been explored that allow the as- signment of electron densities to be performed on a voxel-wise basis. Other methods include atlas-based techniques, where a most representative series is selected from a library of pre-existing MRI images and warped to fit the acquired patient images. The resulting deformation field is then applied to the CT associated with the selected pre-existing MRI, to create a series of CT images in the same frame of the acquired MRI. Although this has also been shown to produce good estimation of dosimetric calculations, it suffers from the inadequacies associated with registration-based ap- proaches, including poor results where the anatomy is vastly different to the datasets in the repository.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Despite a number of solutions to MRI-only workflows, none of the approaches have</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">routinely been adopted in clinical practice as yet, owing to their drawbacks and lack of clinical validation.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.4 <span class="h4">Positron emission tomography</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">All clinical PET/CT systems acquire whole-body PET and standard multi-slice CT images within a single gantry. The maximum displacement error of co-axial imaging using combined PET/CT has been demonstrated to be in the region of 0.5 mm, thereby offering complementary functional and anatomical imaging that can be clin- ically useful.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Due to the presence of both metabolic and structural information of PET/CT im- ages, as well as the availability of electron density maps, they are ideally suited for the radiotherapy planning process. However, most departments worldwide commonly ac- quire diagnostic PET/CT imaging with different patient set-up to that of radiotherapy treatment. Unless dedicated radiotherapy PET/CT scans are performed, the PET/CT images typically serve as a visual guide in the volume definition process, with separate radiotherapy planning scans for dose calculation purposes.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.4.1 <span class="s29">Positron emission tomography settings</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">One recognized drawback of PET/CT imaging is the lack of uniformity in image ac- quisition and reconstruction protocols across different institutions. Non-standardized procedures and settings can affect the quality of the data and limit its generality, as this can result in considerable differences between different centres. Not only does this present as an issue with the accuracy of target delineation and dose modulation, but validation studies will also be difficult to conduct. Although qualitative interpretation of the functional imaging is commonplace, quantitative readings (e.g. standardized uptake value (SUV) for <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG tracer) allows objective comparison. Guidelines have also been published with the aim of standardizing and improving the robustness of the procedures for image acquisition and interpretation to ensure consistency and reduce data variability.<span class="s22">1</span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.4.2 <span class="s29">Sensitivity and specificity of positron emission tomography tracers</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The value of PET imaging is also limited by the sensitivity and specificity of PET tracers administered. For example, <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG provides a measure of glucose me- tabolism, considered to be a good surrogate for tumour-cell density, which tends to be high for most but not all cancers. Additionally, regions of necrosis in large cancers with high cellular turnover may not be adequately identified (Figure 3.1). Conversely, false positivity from tissues with an inflammatory component can re- sult in overestimation of the tumour extent. Physiological factors also typically re- sult in increased uptake, which includes the urinary tract containing the excreted tracer, and metabolically active tissue such as the brain, myocardium, brown fat, and contracting walls of the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, it is recommended that target delineation using PET/CT imaging should be carried out with the support of nu- clear medicine experts to correctly identify tumours and avoid the inclusion of non- disease <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG-avid areas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="374" height="319" alt="image" src="Image_031.gif"/></span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Fig. 3.1 <span class="s25">fused coronal, sagittal, and axial fdG Pet-Ct images show a heterogeneous tracer uptake in a large left lower lobe lung mass. areas of low grade activity (dark grey) suggest tissue necrosis.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.4.3 <span class="s29">Motion</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The duration of a PET scan is typically around 20–30 min., making it susceptible to significant subject and physiological motion. Organ motion is particularly relevant for structures in the chest which, in free breathing, often causes indistinct edges with an inhomogeneous appearance. It has been demonstrated that respiratory misalignments between CT and PET data within a single PET/CT scan can lead to significant under- estimation of the SUV of the attenuation-corrected PET.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Dedicated PET/CT imaging for radiotherapy planning should ideally adopt motion management strategies such as deep inspiration breath-hold to minimize the blurring and improve the inhomogeneity due to movement artefact. Gating schemes can also be employed where data at the corresponding portion of the respiratory cycle can be extracted and processed, thereby increasing the spatial-temporal match. For instance, 3D PET/CT has been shown to underestimate target volume of lung cancers, giving rise to potential geometrical miss compared to 4D PET/CT. In the absence of such respiratory adaptations where treatment is delivered in free breathing, verification of the PET/CT data should be performed in order to ensure accurate representation of the target volume. Errors secondary to misalignments should be corrected to improve the match prior to application of the attenuation correction.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.4.4 <span class="s29">Implementation of PET/CT for radiotherapy purposes</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Recently, multiple advances in PET technology have been implemented to harness its capabilities in PET/CT-guided management in radiation oncology. Examples of this include faster detector electronics which can increase the SNR in PET images, smaller detector size resulting in improved spatial resolution by reducing partial volume effect, retrospective correction for point spread function to gain uniform image resolution and improve image quality, as well as the addition of PET detectors in the z-direction which can improve the volume sensitivity and reduce the scan time through the ex- tended axial field-of-view. Some units have adopted radiotherapy treatment posi- tioning through the installation of big-bore PET/CT systems that allow increased versatility in the use of immobilization equipment and customizable pallets to ensure reproducible patient set-up.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5 <span class="h4">Applications of advanced imaging techniques in radiation oncology</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In this section, the scope and purposes that MRI and PET/CT imaging can serve in the radiotherapy treatment process are illustrated through examples of their use across different tumour sites.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.1 <span class="s29">Target/organ at risk volume delineation</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Volume delineation is one of the key reasons for the increasing use of advanced imaging techniques in the radiotherapy planning process. This is mainly through MRI images, which provide improved contrast resolution over CT across a multitude of tumours and OARs, resulting in better anatomical definition. Functional imaging using PET has also been adopted in some tumour sites, and the application of multi-parametric MRI is being increasingly explored.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.1.1 <span class="s66">Central nervous system</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">One of the earliest body sites to adopt the use of MRI for volume delineation is the brain. Contrast-enhanced MRI provides superior visual discrimination of brain tumours from surrounding oedema over CT images, resulting in reduced intra- and inter-observer tumour delineation variation. Moreover, there are many intra- cranial structures there are poorly seen on CT as compared to MRI. Many of these constitute OARs that are commonly required to be outlined for dosimetric pur- poses, including the optic apparatus, pituitary gland, brainstem, and hippocampus (Figure 3.2).</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The use of MRI for the brain also suffers less drawbacks as compared to other body sites. For instance, the head is less affected by field inhomogeneity due to its relative smaller size. Additionally, co-registration of MRI to planning CT of the head is subject to less set-up errors due to the rigidity of the bony skull.</p><p class="s65" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">18<span class="s44">F-FDG is typically unhelpful as a radiotracer for visualization of structures within the brain due to the high glucose metabolism by normal brain tissue resulting in high uptake.

Oropharyngeal tumours have been reported to appear larger on MRI than CT, where MRI detects disease regions not picked up on CT. Also, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI has higher correlation with pathological findings than conven- tional imaging for the detection of lymph node metastases. Other advantages of MRI- based planning include the reduction of signal degradation with MRI in the presence of dental amalgams which are often close to the regions of interest, as well as improved visualization of OARs such as the spinal cord, brainstem, and parotid glands.</p><p class="s65" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">18<span class="s44">F-FDG PET/CT has an established role in disease identification in head and neck</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">cancers.

Tumour control probability is higher with PET/CT-based planning than conventional CT planning through improved target coverage. Moreover, dose to normal tissue can also be minimized through avoidance of non-tumour regions. For instance, <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG uptake in tumours can help distinguish adjacent regions of lung collapse or atelectasis, which is a classically difficult task based solely on CT appearances. Not only can PET/CT imaging decrease inter-observer vari- ation in radiotherapy treatment planning, a dedicated radiotherapy treatment PET/CT has been shown to reduce the inter-observer differences even further beyond that of a diagnostic scan. Additionally, integration of 4D PET/CT and 4D CT using a respira- tory tracking system to correlate with the breathing cycle can improve the accuracy of SUV quantification for a moving lung tumour.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.1.4 <span class="s66">Breast cancer</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">MRI can aid planning in partial breast irradiation, where MRI-derived volumes have been shown to be smaller than CT-based delineation. Inter-observer contouring variation of tumour bed volumes has been demonstrated to be significantly reduced through MRI use.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.1.5 <span class="s66">Rectal and anal cancers</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The depiction of rectal tumours with anal or sigmoid involvement is superior on MRI, resulting in better delineation accuracy than based on CT only. MRI-derived volumes of rectal cancers also tend to be smaller and shorter, allowing the potential for dose escalation. Interestingly, both MRI and PET/CT, especially automatic PET/ CT delineation, have been significantly correlated with pathological findings, whilst CT-derived volumes did not. Some studies also demonstrated that <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG PET/CT guidance result in smaller volumes than MRI. Other tracers displaying different func- tional characteristics such as <span class="s22">18</span>F-FLT and <span class="s22">18</span>F-FMISO are being explored for their value in radiotherapy planning.</p><p class="s65" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">18<span class="s44">F-FDG PET is being routinely used in the staging of locally advanced anal cancers</span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">due to its greater sensitivity in the detection of primary, nodal, and distant spread of disease as compared to conventional imaging. It is an invaluable tool in radiotherapy planning, where contours are modified to ensure that node positive disease is encom- passed within the treated volume. Studies evaluating its role in dose escalation for locally advanced disease are currently under way.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.1.6 <span class="s66">Prostate cancer</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Multiple studies have shown that MRI is more reliable than CT for radiotherapy plan- ning as the prostate gland is overestimated on CT appearances. MRI use has improved accuracy and decreased inter-observer variability in delineation of both prostate gland and OARs, which corresponded with a reduction of dose to normal tissues compared to CT. The ESTRO ACROP guidelines summarize how MRI adds integral information for delineation.<span class="s22">4 </span>In addition to bolstering the identification of seminal vesical invasion and extracapsular extension, MRI allows better approximation of the prostate apex</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">and enhanced discrimination of the prostate from OARs especially in the presence of hip prostheses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Radio-labelled choline PET has been proven to be a reliable biomarker for staging of prostate cancer. Not only have there been reports on the value of choline-PET on BTV definition for tumoural extra-prostatic extension, it has been demonstrated that it can help define the sub-volume for delivering an integrated boost to prostate which can im- prove tumour control rates. Newer radiotracers targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have been shown to be beneficial following radical prostatectomy by playing a pivotal role in staging and determining the volume in salvage radiotherapy. It has been demonstrated that whilst the target can be underestimated if based solely on the widely adopted RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) contouring guide- lines,<span class="s22">5 </span>coverage of lymph node regions at risk of occult relapse is improved when PSMA PET is used. Its utility in volume definition of dominant intraprostatic lesions for dose boosts is being explored in association with multi-parametric MRI.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.1.7 <span class="s66">Gynaecological</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">MRI guidance for brachytherapy in cervix cancer has been shown to be superior to radiograph/CT-based planning, and is recommended by the GEC-ESTRO guidelines for volume definition.<span class="s22">6 </span>The enhanced visualization of tumours on MRI allows brachy- therapy cervical boost to be individually tailored according to the appearances of the residual tumour volume following external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The most widely adopted technique is the acquisition of MRI images following applicator inser- tion for contouring and planning purposes, with T2-weighted sequences in the orien- tation of the applicator being the gold standard for target definition. In addition to the use of concomitant chemotherapy and improved staging, MRI-guided brachytherapy has contributed to improved overall survival by up to 30%, whilst significantly redu- cing morbidity when compared to historical controls. Major improvement in local control was most marked in large tumours through the use of dose escalation and interstitial needles.</p><p class="s65" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">18<span class="s44">F-FDG PET/CT has also influenced the coverage of EBRT treatment fields, where</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">extended field irradiation has been shown to improve the survival rate in the presence of <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG PET/CT positive para-aortic nodal disease.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.1.8 <span class="s66">Lymphoma</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The incorporation of <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG PET/CT in treatment planning to target metabolically active disease has led to the development of involved-site and involved-nodal radio- therapy techniques.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.1.9 <span class="s66">Oesophageal</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The target definition of oesophageal cancer runs a risk of disease underestimation in the cranio-caudal plane. Several reports have demonstrated that <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG PET/CT can reduce geographical miss in the delineation of the primary tumour, and has been found to be complementary to endoscopic ultrasound in determining the cranio- caudal extent of disease.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.2 <span class="s29">Dose escalation and dose painting</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The addition of MRI and/or PET/CT have led to smaller target volumes, giving rise to the potential for radiotherapy dose escalation. Dose modulation based on the biological char- acteristics of the tumour (i.e. dose painting) can be applied up front or during the course of the treatment. To date, most dose painting studies have been PET/CT-based.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.2.1 <span class="s66">Head and neck cancers</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Despite the ability of DWI and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to discrim- inate regions within head and neck tumours and the link between low perfusion with poorer outcomes, their use in dose painting has been sparsely reported. On the other hand, most developments in dose painting of head and neck cancers are based on PET/CT imaging. <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG PET/CT has been shown to provide prognostic informa- tion, and it has been estimated that up to a 30% higher dose is required in order to achieve similar local tumour control for cancers with FDG-avidity compared to le- sions with lower uptake. ARTFORCE is a phase III international clinical trial on adap- tive high-dose radiotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer where the impact of dose modulation based on <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG PET/CT is being evaluated.<span class="s22">7 </span>The utility of other PET tracers that detect hypoxia (e.g. <span class="s22">18</span>F-FAZA, <span class="s22">18</span>F-FMISO, and <span class="s22">64</span>Cu-ATSM) is being investigated for its role in dose intensification of intra-tumoural regions displaying hypoxic features. Similarly, <span class="s22">18</span>F-FLT, a measure of tumour proliferation, has been used to identify boost regions for dose escalation, although its association with tumour con- trol has yet to be fully established.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.2.2 <span class="s66">Lung cancer</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Biologically equivalent dose has been highly correlated with overall survival and loco- regional, relapse-free survival in locally advanced NSCLC, establishing the efficacy of dose escalation in this setting. There have been several reports on personalizing dose escalation based on pre-treatment <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG and <span class="s22">18</span>F-FMISO PET metrics in lo- cally advanced NSCLC. Additionally, dose adaptation based on the interim response of <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG PET to treatment is also being evaluated, by exploiting its ability to detect the resistant sub-volumes in the middle of the course of radiotherapy.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.2.3 <span class="s66">Rectal cancer</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">There are multiple reports on dose escalation for rectal cancers through simultaneous integrated boost which allows increased dose to be delivered to the tumour volume without extension of the overall treatment time. Although simultaneous integrated dose boost as guided by <span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG PET has been described, further investigation into boost strategies incorporating MRI and PET guidance are awaited.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.5.2.4 <span class="s66">Prostate</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In the setting of whole prostate gland low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy for early stage disease, the superiority in anatomical definition that MRI provides improves the confidence in dosimetric parameters for plan assessment. Moreover, it offers unparal- leled views of intraprostatic characteristics, and has an established role in the planning</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boosts for higher risk, localized, and/or recur- rent disease. Multiparametric imaging, including T2-weighted, apparent diffusion co- efficient (ADC) maps from DWI and K<span class="s22">trans </span>maps from DCE sequences are being used to localize tumour targets. The role of partial gland irradiation where additional dose is delivered to focal regions of the prostate in combination with EBRT is being investi- gated in the PIVOTAL boost trial.<span class="s22">8</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3.5.3 <span class="s29">Image-guided radiotherapy: MRI-LINAC</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The management of tumour and organ motion is one of the key challenges in radio- therapy delivery. Although planning target volumes encompass the error associated with this, large margins increase the risk of clinically significant toxicity, especially near critical organs. Image-guided radiotherapy allows the delivery to be reprodu- cible through the visualization of the tumour and surrounding anatomy at the time of treatment. There is a range of solutions which is dependent on the treatment location, including tracking systems and devices, electronic portal imaging devices (EPID), as well as kV and MV CT imaging platforms. Fiducial markers can also be placed for selected tumour sites and used as surrogates for visualization.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Recently, there is growth in the installation of MRI-guided treatment systems, which encompasses an MRI scanner and a LINAC (linear particle accelerator) treatment de- livery facility all within the same unit. This has advantages over EPID and CT-based verification systems through improved soft-tissue contrast, enabling better visualiza- tion of the more challenging body sites such as the oesophagus, pancreas, and rectum. Online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) can then be applied to correct for the differences seen in the anatomy. A number of solutions exist for this: (1) shifting the patient to match the relative anatomy seen on the day; (2) selection of a treatment plan from a pre-prepared library with the best fit to the anatomy acquired at the time of treatment;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">(3) applying translational and rotational shifts to the dose distribution to suit the pa- tient position; (4) applying a deformation field where the original dose distribution is warped based on image of the day; (5) online/real-time re-planning with generation of new target outlines and dose calculations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">With no radiation exposure, MRI-guided systems are ideally suited for continuous visualization of the tumour during treatment delivery in real-time, permitting the tracking of intra-fractional motion of soft tissues. The technology also enables imple- mentation of other techniques such as gating in treatment delivery, which is useful for tumours that are subjected to respiratory motion. The MRI-LINAC platform is also highly applicable in stereotactic treatment, which capitalizes on the precision of treat- ment to employ the use of hypofractionated dose schedules, as well as in re-irradiation to ensure the safety of the dose delivery.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Moreover, this presents the opportunity for biomarker discovery studies from the wealth of potentially minable data on the response to treatment. With the scope for performing functional sequences, this allows the potential for personalized adaptation of therapy according to the biological images acquired at the time of treatment.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.6 <span class="h4">Future work</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The incorporation of MRI and PET/CT imaging has dramatically altered radiotherapy planning practices recently. The landscape is continuing to evolve with multiple prom- ising avenues on the horizon.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">There is ongoing research into the exploitation of information acquired through multi-parametric MRI and PET imaging for advancing dose delivery techniques, espe- cially where there is strong evidence of a biological rationale and improved outcomes. For many institutions further adaptations and upgrades to systems need to be carried out, with the increasing demand for their incorporation in radiation practice.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Another field of work includes radiomics, which has recently become an actively explored domain with an increasing number of groups working on the extraction of radiomic signatures from functional imaging to derive prognostic information. This involves the harvesting of mathematical descriptions from particular regions of interest which serve as imaging biomarkers. Apart from its promise in disease prog- nostication, other uses warrant future developments, including its application with MR and PET data.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">There is great interest with advent of machine learning algorithms as a tool for data mining and for addressing issues that have been historically performed by humans. Its application and validity in autosegmentation of images including MRI and PET is being actively explored across a range of body sites, with early indicators of success.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Hybrid imaging with combined PET/MRI is an emerging technology which allows the unique opportunity for assessing the functional and biological characteristics of tumours within a single examination. The benefits of a fully integrated imaging system allowing simultaneous assessment of multiple pathophysiological parameters may fur- ther improve radiotherapy treatment planning and dose painting.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s73" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">References</p><p class="s74" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">1. <b>Boellaard R</b>, <b>Delgado-Bolton R</b>, <b>Oyen WJG, et al. </b>(2015).
