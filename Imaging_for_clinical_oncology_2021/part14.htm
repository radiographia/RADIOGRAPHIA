There is a particularly high incidence in Asia and South America. The incidence of adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia has rapidly increased over the past 20 years, whilst the incidence of distal stomach cancers has decreased. Adenocarcinomas of the lower oesophagus have also increased at the same rate. It is often difficult to distinguish the origin of tumours at the oesophagogastric junction (OGJ). Tumours within 5 cm of the oesophagogastric junction and those in the proximal gastric cardia can be grouped together as “junctional tumours”. These are subclassified in to Siewert type 1, centred in the distal oesophagus. Siewert type 2, centred on the junction itself and Siewert Type 3, those centred in the gastric cardia, the latter staged as gastric tumours.<span class="s22">1</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s96" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.2 <span class="h4">Diagnosis and staging</span></p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.2.1 <span class="s29">Diagnosis</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Endoscopy is the modality of choice for diagnosing gastric tumours, allowing for exact localization and biopsy for histology.<span class="s22">2 </span>In the diagnosis of scirrhous carcinoma, which diffusely infiltrates the stomach wall (linitis plastica) the endoscopic appear- ance may be normal as the infiltration is submucosal and a lack of stomach disten- sion on endoscopic insufflation or imaging studies may be the only indication of disease. More specific tailored computed tomography (CT) protocols (see section 8.2.2) allow for higher detection rates. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may be used to perform submucosal biopsies if the endoscopic guided mucosal biopsies are inconclusive.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.2.2 <span class="s29">Staging</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">CT is the cornerstone of staging of gastric tumours. EUS, diagnostic laparoscopy, and occasionally <span class="s22">18</span>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tom- ography (FDG PET/CT) are useful modalities, particularly as problem-solving tools. As described, EUS can be used to perform submucosal biopsies to confirm a cancer diagnosis, but may also be utilized to distinguish subtle infiltration and involvement of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">adjacent organs such as the pancreas or liver, indicating T4 disease. EUS can also ac- curately define lymph node involvement and be used to biopsy lymph nodes outside a normal operative field to exclude in effect what would be metastatic disease. Although CT is adequate for visualization of most liver metastases MRI is more sensitive for detection of subtle liver lesions.<span class="s22">2,3 </span>Staging of gastric cancers is based on the TNM (tu- mour, node, metastasis) classification.<span class="s22">4</span></p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.2.2.1 <span class="s98">T stage</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection and staging, the stomach should be distended with water, or other low Hounsfield unit fluid, prior to CT image acquisition. This is helpful in distinguishing subtle thickening or mass lesions arising from the gastric wall from the pseudo-thickening which can result from an undistended stomach. Appearances of gastric cancers on CT can range from focal wall thickening with or without ulceration (Figure 8.1), to a soft tissue mass, to diffuse wall thickening in linitis plastica. Following injection of intravenous contrast medium tumours can show variable degrees of contrast en- hancement. Lower attenuation lesions may correspond with fibrosis or mucinous tumours. It can be helpful to study the stomach using multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs). Curved MPRs are useful to distinguish tumours abutting adjacent organs from invading adjacent organs (Figure 8.2).<span class="s22">5 </span>The overall accuracy of CT in staging gastric cancer ranges from 77% to 89%.<span class="s22">6 </span>Studies using these specific tailored scan- ning and reconstruction techniques with multidetector CT and ‘virtual gastroscopy’, show increasing accuracy in T staging, and sensitivity for detecting the early gas- tric cancers (EGCs). Using these state-of-the-art techniques, CT can detect gastric cancer (in mixed series of advanced gastric cancers (AGCs) and EGCs) with 94–98% accuracy and T stage correctly in 84–89%.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="192" height="183" alt="image" src="Image_123.png"/></span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: left;">Fig. 8.1 <span class="s52">axial contrast-enhanced CT demonstrating circumferential mural thickening caused by a lesser curve adenocarcinoma.

As in the oesophagus, the normal layers of the stomach wall can be clearly visualized on EUS. Most tumours appear hypoechoic with irregular margins, disrupting these layers. EUS is particularly sen- sitive for early stage tumours confined to the mucosa and submucosa (T1 and T2). However, it is operator dependent with a learning curve, hence its availability is often confined to regional centres. Where there is coexisting inflammation, the extent of disease can be overestimated.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.2.2.2 <span class="s98">N stage</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Although current N staging depends on the number of positive lymph nodes rather than the previously described nodal stations, the latter is important as prognosis is also dependent on extent of lymphadenectomy. Involvement of the hepatoduodenal nodes, retropancreatic, mesenteric, para-aortic, or more distant nodes are con- sidered as metastatic disease being outside the most widely performed operative field. CT is the modality of choice for lymph node staging. It can detect the more distant lymph nodes (compartments 3 and 4) that may influence the surgeon to ei- ther perform an extended lymphadenectomy or not to offer curative resection at all. The overall accuracy of lymph node staging by CT is, at best, around 80%. The main limitation of using CT to assess lymph node size and shape as a means of predicting tumour involvement is that this is unreliable, often over- as well as under-staging the disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">EUS is a useful adjunct for confirming lymph node involvement but limited to nodes within the limited imaging field. EUS has been reported as having diagnostic accuracy of 70–90%. In a comparative series of 63 patients, similar accuracies were</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">reported between EUS (79%) and CT (75%). There may be a role for FDG PET/CT in the staging of gastric cancer in detecting involved but normal sized nodes and distant metastases.<span class="s22">7</span></p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.2.2.3 <span class="s98">Distant metastases</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">CT is the modality of choice. Liver metastases are present in approximately 25% of newly diagnosed patients with AGC. Other sites including lung, bone, and adrenal me- tastases are less common but can be also detected with CT. Subtle peritoneal deposits are the most commonly missed form of metastasis using cross-sectional imaging and will require laparoscopy for diagnosis. The presence of ascites may, however, indicate peritoneal disease. In a female patient, it is important to include the pelvis as ovarian drop metastases, otherwise known as ‘Krukenberg tumours’, may be found. If there are no metastases on imaging, staging laparoscopy is indicated and this can influence the clinical management in up to 20% of cases. FDG PET/CT may be useful in non-diffuse cancers to exclude suspected occult metastatic disease.<span class="s22">7</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s96" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.3 <span class="h4">Treatment</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The standard treatment in non-Asian patients with gastric cancers which are T2 or greater is perioperative chemotherapy followed by surgery. In Asia, primary surgery is more often followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. For junctional adenocarcinoma, there is a survival benefit for preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or perioperative chemotherapy.<span class="s22">8,9</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Following curative resection, many patients remain at high risk of locoregional re- currence. The US Intergroup 0116 Trial showed that the use of postoperative CRT (45 Gy in 25 fractions with synchronous 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and folinic acid) improved overall survival when compared with surgery alone in patients who had curative resec- tion (R0). This approach has decreased in use since perioperative chemotherapy has been more widely adopted.<span class="s22">10</span></p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.3.1 <span class="s29">Role of radiotherapy and imaging for treatment planning</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Following good quality surgery, the role of postoperative CRT remains uncertain. If the decision is to treat the patient with postoperative CRT (e.g. if circumferential re- section margin positive tumours), preparation should include ensuring that the pa- tient has sufficiently recovered from surgery, has an adequate nutritional intake (with or without support), and has optimal renal function. Both glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as well as differential renal function—DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) or MAG3 (mercaptoacetyl triglycine)—should be assessed, as the radiation dose to one kidney will often exceed tolerance and it is important to ensure that the function of the other kidney is adequate.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The planning CT scan should be in the supine position with the arms raised, starting from above liver to below kidneys to allow generation of dose volume histograms (DVH) for organs at risk. Addition of intravenous contrast and dilute gastrograffin to opacify the bowel is helpful to define the various anatomical structures. The oncologist</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">needs to be familiar with the original site and extent of tumour, using information from preoperative CT, endoscopy, surgical notes, histology report, and, importantly, multidisciplinary team discussion. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) should be used for optimal sparing of normal tissue.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In the palliative setting, short courses of radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions or 20 Gy 5 fractions) to the stomach using parallel opposed anterior and posterior fields simulated with barium contrast can help to control bleeding or pain. In addition, single dose radiotherapy to painful bony metastases can be effective in controlling symptoms and improving quality of life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s96" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.4 <span class="h4">Therapeutic assessment and follow-up</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Disease recurrence is common within the first two years of surgery and is associated with a poor prognosis. The benefit of postoperative imaging to identify asymptomatic recurrent disease remains unproven. When there is clinical suspicion of recurrence, CT is the imaging modality of choice. It is also used to assess response to further therapy using standard reporting criteria (Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors— RECIST).<span class="s22">11 </span>The ability of FDG PET/CT to detect abnormal metabolic function has an emerging role, as CT cannot reliably differentiate post-treatment changes from recur- rent or residual active disease. In the setting of neoadjuvant treatment FDG PET/CT may have a role in predicting response early in the course of therapy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s96" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8.5 <span class="h4">Summary</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">CT remains the main modality for staging and determining resectability, but more comprehensive information is provided by a multimodality approach (CT, EUS, laparoscopy, and PET).</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">The role for routine imaging following curative treatment remains unproven.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s73" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">References</p><p class="s74" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">1. <b>Siewert RJ</b>, <b>Feith M</b>, <b>Werner M, et al. </b>(2000).
