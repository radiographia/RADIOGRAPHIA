They occur at the anal verge (25%) or within the anal canal tumours (75%). Squamous cell carcinomas make up 97% of anal cancers, with other rarer types including adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumours, undifferentiated carcinomas, melanomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, verrucous carcinomas, and lymphomas.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Peak incidence is in the sixth decade of life. The pathogenesis is multifactorial. However, the predominant risk factor is exposure to the human papilloma virus, pri- marily HPV-16 and HPV-18. It is positive in 90% of anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). The impact of the implementation of HPV vaccination may reduce incidence. However, the full impact of this will not become apparent for decades. Additional risk factors include other sexually transmitted viruses, smoking, multiple sexual partners, anal intercourse, chronic inflammation, and immunosuppression, including HIV. Patients with anal cancer are more likely to have had a previous malignancy and more likely to develop a further malignancy (e.g. cervix, vulva, or vagina). Small early can- cers may cause few symptoms, and are sometimes diagnosed serendipitously with the removal of anal tags. More advanced lesions present as non-healing ulcers, with peri- neal pain, sensation of a mass, rectal bleeding, itching, discharge, and faecal incontin- ence. Tumours may be diagnosed concomitantly with a benign anal condition such as haemorrhoids, anal fissure, or fistula.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Anal cancer is predominantly a locoregional disease, metastasizing first to the local</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">lymph nodes such as mesorectal, internal iliac, pre-sacral, obturator, external iliac, or inguinal. Only 10% of patients present with metastatic disease. A small cohort of early anal cancers, particularly at the anal verge, can undergo a local excision, maintaining their sphincter with curative intent. If these patients have disease within 1 mm of the margin they undergo adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. For the majority of those with lo- calized disease, the standard curative treatment is definitive chemoradiation (CRT) with concomitant mitomycin and either 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. The three-year disease free survival (DFS) following this treatment is 73%.<span class="s22">1 </span>For those with metastatic disease the standard treatment is systemic therapy with palliative intent, the median survival is approximately 12 months.</p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13.2 <span class="h4">Diagnosis and staging</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Diagnosis is made typically by clinical examination, proctoscopy, and biopsy. Direct proctoscopy is often difficult in more advanced lesions because of pain; patients then undergo examination under anaesthetic (EUA) and biopsy. Digital rectal examination (DRE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) are re- quired for full staging. DRE allows clinical measurement of tumour size, site, and dis- tance from anal verge. MRI pelvis offers information on size, infiltration of adjacent organs, whether there is extension above the dentate line and below the anal margin, and nodal status. Figure 13.1 demonstrates anal cancer on T2 weighted MRI. CT of the thorax and abdomen offers further information on involved nodes as well as assessing whether or not there is metastatic disease.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Although not standard, diagnostic imaging in anal cancer, 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG PET/CT), is highly sensitive and increas- ingly used for patients in selected cases. A recent systematic review reported the sensitivity for PET was 99%, while only 67% for CT. In inguinal lymph nodes the sen- sitivity was 93% and specificity 76%. There is a cohort of patients who are upstaged or downstaged by FDG PET/CT (5.1–37.5% and 8.2–26.7% respectively).<span class="s22">2 </span>However, Mistrangelo et al. compared findings on PET/CT with pathological conformation on SNB and reported that PET/CT demonstrated a high number of false positive re- sults.<span class="s22">3 </span>Therefore, positive results on PET/CT should be discussed in multidisciplinary</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="297" height="294" alt="image" src="Image_190.gif"/></span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fig. 13.1 <span class="s52">a patient with t2W MRi scans demonstrating high signal asCC.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="140" alt="image" src="Image_191.png"/></span></p><p class="s30" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(a)</p><p class="s30" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(a)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s30" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(a)</p><p class="s30" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(b)</p><p class="s30" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(b)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s30" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">(b)</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: left;">Fig. 13.2 <span class="s52">FDG pet/Ct scan demonstrating an FDG avid primary and a liver metastasis not picked up on routine Ct scan.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">setting in order to decide whether an FDG avid lymph node is involved, not involved, or requires further investigation such as an FNA, to facilitate a treatment decision. Figure 13.2 demonstrates the FDG avid primary and one of multiple liver metastases not detected by CT scan.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Investigation is ongoing regarding the use of molecular metabolic imaging as a pre- dictive factor of outcome. A number of studies have suggested that baseline levels of FDG avidity can predict for presence of lymph node metastasis, locoregional failure, and disease-free survival following treatment.<span class="s22">4 </span>Two small studies have suggested that the FDG derived metabolically active volume on diagnostic images correlate with areas of local recurrence, although this may be due to larger tumours being more metabolically active and large tumours are proven to do worse.<span class="s22">5,6 </span>A further study highlighted that heterogeneity analysis performed on a baseline MRI can predict for outcome.<span class="s22">7 </span>All these potential predictive imaging markers require further investiga- tion in larger cohorts.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Staging is based on the TNM (tumour, node, metastasis) classification.<span class="s22">8 </span>This classifi- cation is based on clinical factors such as tumour size (assessed by clinical examination and imaging studies) and the site rather than number of local nodes. This is applicable to all carcinomas arising from the canal apart from melanoma.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s96" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13.3 <span class="h4">Imaging for radiotherapy</span></p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13.3.1 <span class="s29">Radiation treatment</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Radiation is now delivered routinely using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In comparison to conformal treatment, IMRT reduces the grade 3 non-haematological toxicity of treatment from 49% to 40% and the number of patients requiring interrup- tions in their treatment, or discontinuing early due to toxicity.<span class="s22">9 </span>A simultaneous inte- grated boost (SIB) technique is used to deliver a radical dose to the primary tumour as well as a prophylactic dose to lymph nodes at risk of micrometastatic disease at the same time. Early primary tumours (T1,2 N0) receive 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions; more locally ad- vanced (T3,4 or node positive) receive 53.2 Gy; the prophylactic nodes receive 40 Gy.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13.3.2 <span class="s29">Treatment planning process</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Patients undergo a single planning CT scan in the supine position, with immobiliza- tion for popliteal fossa and feet. Patients are scanned with a comfortably full bladder. If there is infiltration of the buttocks they are placed on a pyrex sheet to enable build- up of dose. If there is infiltration of the skin around involved inguinal nodes, bolus is placed on the affected skin. Intravenous contrast is routinely delivered to enable easier delineation of vessels and GTV. An anal marker is often placed at the anal verge or on the excision scar or surrounding the disease if it is infiltrating the buttocks and difficult to define on CT.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13.3.3 <span class="s29">Target volume definition</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Co-registration of the diagnostic MRI and PET with the planning scan may improve accuracy of target volume delineation. However, differences in set-up during image acquisitions and poor registration could lead to potential inaccuracies which should be considered. Other imaging formats are being investigated for target volume de- lineation, for example DW MRI has been demonstrated to improve inter-observer agreement in assigning T stage and aid delineation of gross tumour volume<span class="s22">10 </span>and the potential of an FDG derived biological GTV has been highlighted due to the reprodu- cibility of the biological boost over a course of CRT.<span class="s22">11 </span>These need further investigation in larger cohorts.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The primary tumour GTV (<i>GTV_A</i>) includes all areas of macroscopic primary tu- mour visible on contrast enhanced planning CT; length and distance from anal verge on DRE, EUA, or proctoscopy, and the MRI. The volume is limited to the gross tumour and does not include the whole lumen.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The nodal GTV (<i>GTV_N</i>) should be determined using the planning CT, inguinal node examination, MRI, and FDG PET/CT. All macroscopically involved nodes should be encompassed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The GTV_A is then enlarged by 1 cm (for early tumours) and 1.5 cm (for locally advanced tumours) in order to encompass microscopic disease to create the CTV_</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">A. These margins are based on pathological data from skin squamous cell cancers, suggesting larger tumours have larger distance of microscopic infiltration from the primary tumour. The CTV_A is then enlarged by a further 1 cm to create the PTV_A which is the target for the high dose boost.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The GTV_N is enlarged by 0.5 cm to encompass microscopic disease within CTV_N and finally an additional 0.5 cm to allow for set-up errors to create PTV_N. The PTV_ N receives 50.4 Gy unless the nodes are &gt;3 cm, in which case they receive 53.2 Gy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The elective nodes (CTV_E) are the nodes that are at risk of microscopic disease. These are the mesorectal, internal iliac, external iliac, pre-sacral, obturator, and in- guinal lymph nodes. A UK national guidance is available to aid with delineation.<span class="s22">12 </span>The CTV_E is enlarged by 0.5 cm to create the PTV_E which receives 40 Gy in 28 fractions.

The rate of APR in patients with an incomplete response to CRT is only 40%.<span class="s22">14 </span>Hence it is important to assess patients closely following treatment to ensure an ongoing response. A DRE exam is performed at six weeks following completion of CRT to ensure the ASCC is reducing in size. An MRI at this stage is of limited benefit.<span class="s22">15 </span>If the tumour increases in size at any point following completion of CRT of the primary tumour, an early APR should be pursued as these patients can rapidly become inoperable. The optimal time to assess response following CRT is 26 weeks following treatment,<span class="s22">16 </span>which is used as the time point for definitive CR assessment in trials.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Surveillance is typically performed by clinical examination three-monthly, MRI at three and six months and CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis annually to exclude macroscopic metastasis. It is known that 75% of anal relapses occur at the site of the primary tumour, and DRE picks these up before any imaging; hence the high fre- quency of clinical follow-up. If a local recurrence can be identified early those with local recurrence can still undergo curative salvage APR if localized. Of those with local relapse, 80% undergo APR with a two-year DFS of 70%.<span class="s22">14</span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">FDG PET/CT on completion of treatment has demonstrated correlation with one or more of: local control rate, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, or overall survival.<span class="s22">17 </span>This holds potential for reducing the intensive clinical follow-up that occurs in these patients but must be tested in a prospective study prior to clinical use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s96" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">13.5 <span class="h4">Summary</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">MRI is the preferred modality for local staging due to its superior contrast reso- lution.
