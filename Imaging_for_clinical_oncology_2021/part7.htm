With perhaps the exception of a small superficial basal cell carcinoma all patients will require imaging evaluation of their malignancy. Therefore, it is essential that the principles of imaging and the specific requirements for each tumour site are clearly understood by those involved in the management of patients with malignant disease to enable optimum use of this essential modality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.2 <span class="h4">The role of imaging</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The role of imaging is extensive and integral to management at any point in the patient’s journey. At their initial presentation imaging may have led to the discovery of a tumour, resulting in an image-guided or surgical procedure to confirm its malignant nature. It will then be essential to assess the full extent of that tumour and define the tumour stage by evaluating pathways of direct, lymphatic, and blood borne spread. The tumour stage is critical to subsequent management and it is therefore vital that full and appropriate imaging is undertaken at this point.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">For the patient having radiotherapy, an accurate assessment of the tumour to be treated and of the surrounding organs at risk is critical to planning radiotherapy. Detailed evaluation with diagnostic imaging is essential for delivering optimal radio- therapy. The most important step in radiotherapy planning is tumour localization and, with the few exceptions of readily palpable and visible skin tumours, a full ap- preciation of the anatomical localization, involvement of surrounding structures, and proximity to critical organs is essential, and can only be provided through appropriate radiological investigations.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Following treatment, further management is based on response assessment and continued surveillance in which imaging will play a major part. It is important to have an understanding of the positive and negative predictive value of a test and the level of reliance that can be placed upon it. This is particularly the case in the setting of response assessment when patients having persistent disease may be subject to major salvage procedures on the basis of failure to achieve a radiological complete response.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2 <span><img width="0" height="17" alt="image" src="Image_004.png"/></span><span class="s20"> </span><span class="s21">CHaPter 1: IntroduCtIon</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.3 <span class="h4">Imaging modalities</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">X-ray imaging was available soon after the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895. It is remarkable that despite technical improvements in the production of plain X-ray images and increased understanding of the use of contrast materials it took almost 80 years for the next revolution in imaging to appear in the clinical setting with the introduction of computed tomography (CT).</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Since then, there has been a major revolution in imaging, with ever more sophis- ticated and rapid CT imaging, and progressive integration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and molecular imaging techniques—<span class="s22">18</span>F-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (<span class="s22">18</span>F-FDG PET/CT)—in radiotherapy planning.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Simultaneously, radiotherapy techniques have evolved from two-dimensional plan- ning to modern high-precision techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), tomotherapy, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), adaptive radiotherapy, and proton beam therapy. Imaging modal- ities such as stereoscopic X-ray, CT scan, and MRI are also integrated with the therapy machines to ensure accurate delivery.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The result of these dramatic technological changes is that a modern cancer centre has a sophisticated range of imaging modalities available for each patient, to provide detailed information on both the anatomical distribution and physiological character- istics of the tumour in question. The challenge in this setting is to optimize the use of each modality in order to obtain the most accurate and reliable information possible with the technology available.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.4 <span class="h4">Integration into the radiotherapy department</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Modern radiotherapy is a complex multistep process, optimizing the many features of a modern linear accelerator and, recently, that of particle therapy machines in order to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumour yet minimizing exposure to surrounding organs at risk, thus ensuring that patients receive accurate reproducible treatment. Imaging is an integral component of many of the stages through which a patient will pass in the radiotherapy department. The technological developments in imaging in recent years have also driven important changes in the radiotherapy department.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Currently, most radiotherapy departments use three-dimensional (3D) CT-based planning systems in which a CT scan is imported into a radiotherapy planning com- puter system and the treatment volume, together with the organs at risk (OAR), are defined on screen on sequential CT images. The use of intravenous contrast can be useful in radiotherapy planning to distinguish vessels from abnormal soft tissue struc- tures such as lymph nodes. Large volumes of oral contrast to outline bowel are not used because large volumes of contrast can alter the absorption characteristics of the dosimetric calculations.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Four-dimensional (4D) CT scans are useful in situations where tumour movement during respiration is likely. Co-registration of MRI sequences is used where MR is su- perior to CT in demarcating tumour and normal tissue structures: particular examples</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">would include the brain and pelvis (for prostate, bladder, and uterine tumours). <span class="s22">18</span>F FDG PET/CT images could improve further the accuracy of treatment volume delin- eation for lung and head and neck cancers and lymphoma.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">During the treatment planning process, radiation physicists and dosimetrists de- rive an optimal beam arrangement based on the intended radiotherapy volume and delivery technique to achieve a homogeneous dose distribution within the planning target volume (PTV), whilst minimizing dose to OARs. Information from the plan- ning CT scan is used for dosimetric calculations. Currently, MR is not used in radio- therapy dosimetry. This is because of the distortion characteristics at the edge of the MR field so that the patient outline is less accurate and also the fact that the informa- tion on X-ray absorption heterogeneities is not obtained in the process of MR scan- ning. With the evolution of the MRI-Linac, there are increasing efforts to incorporate MRI dosimetry for adaptive radiotherapy, but this remains investigational at present.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.5 <span class="h4">Summary</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">Imaging is an integral component of patient care throughout the cancer journey, being required for diagnosis and staging, radiotherapy planning, and subsequent response evaluation and follow-up.</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">The evolution of imaging in recent years with widespread availability of increas- ingly sophisticated CT, MR, and molecular imaging has driven major changes in radiotherapy practice.</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">The precise requirements for individual tumours and tumour sites vary and a clear appreciation of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different imaging modal- ities for a given patient is essential.</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">It is critical to bear in mind that increased use of ionizing-radiation based imaging exposes the patient to a higher concomitant radiation dose, the long-term sequelae of which are as yet to be fully evaluated.</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">Clear justification based on sound evidence is essential in this setting for each diag- nostic radiation exposure to ensure that the imaging tools are used optimally for each patient.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part6.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part8.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
